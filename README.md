# 2771---Research-Methods-for-Business-Analytics

# Research Methods for Business Analytics Project

This project originated as a group assignment for the **Research Methods for Business Analytics (2771)** course at Nova School of Business and Economics University. Since then, I have completely reworked and expanded it on my own.

Below, you'll find the grading criteria from the original project, included here to provide context for the work.

## Group Assignment Instructions & Grading Criteria

This document describes the requirements and grading criteria for the RMBA 2771 Fall 2024 group assignment.

The learning objective of this assignment is to test whether the students can apply the methods they learned in class to a real-world data set. It assesses the following skills:

*   Can the students identify an interesting research question and derive testable hypotheses?
*   Are the students able to select appropriate statistical tests to test their hypotheses?
*   Can the students apply these statistical tests to a real-world data set and implement them in Python?
*   Can the students interpret their findings and clearly communicate their results in a comprehensive report in a Jupyter Notebook?

### Deliverable:

The following deliverable will be used to evaluate the learning objective:

*   One Jupyter Notebook per team submitted via Moodle (Deadline: one week prior to the final exam 12.10.2024).

The Jupyter Notebook should document the analysis and present the findings, along with supporting statistics and figures. The final report should assume its reader has no prior knowledge about the data set.

The Notebook must include at least the following sections:

1.  **Executive Summary** – A short summary that highlights the goal of the project and core findings.
2.  **Introduction** – A section that describes (in words) the dataset and variables. This section should clearly state the research question(s) and the related hypotheses and describe a plan to test them.
3.  **Exploratory data analysis** – A section that uses different statistical metrics and visualizations to describe the data set and presents the first descriptive insights.
4.  **Method 1** – This section should describe why a specific method (e.g., t-test, linear regression, logistic regression, cluster analysis, factor analysis, time series model, or panel regression) is used to test a hypothesis. It should apply the method to the data set, check the most important assumptions, and provide an interpretation of the results obtained (i.e., what did we learn about the hypotheses, how good is the model).
5.  **Method 2** – This section should contain the same information as the previous section but with another method to test a different hypothesis.
6.  **Conclusion** – This section should discuss the findings and explain what we learned about the research question. Further, it should discuss the chosen approach's limitations and ways to improve the analysis.
7.  **References** (optional)

### Important Notes:

*   The final report should be clean. Remove code cells that do not run (i.e., cells you used to try some code) and internal notes that are only for your team.
*   Add comments to your code and clearly explain your process to the reader.
*   Use markdown cells and headings to structure your notebook.
*   Run all cells of your notebook before you submit it to show your results and to see if they run in order!

### Grading Criteria:

We will use the following criteria to grade each notebook.

#### Structure of the notebook (15 points)

*   **0 points:** Two or more sections are missing.
*   **5 points:** One section is missing, or the notebook is significantly difficult to follow or misses significant explanations in multiple sections.
*   **10 points:** The report includes all required sections and provides explanations of the most important steps but is difficult to follow in some sections.
*   **15 points:** The report includes all required sections, provides detailed explanations of what has been done, and is easy to follow.

#### Research question and hypotheses (10 points)

*   **0 points:** The report misses either a research question or does not develop hypotheses related to the research question.
*   **5 points:** The report states a research question but has some flaws in the hypotheses or does not explain why the research question is important and interesting.
*   **10 points:** The report states a clear research question(s), explains why this question(s) is important and interesting and derives a set of hypotheses suitable for investigating the research question(s).

#### Exploratory data analysis (20 points)

*   **0 points:** The report does not provide an exploratory data analysis.
*   **5 points:** The report only provides some descriptive statistics with no relation to the research question and with major flaws.
*   **10 points:** The report explores some descriptive statistics with no clear relation to the research question or has major flaws in some parts of the exploratory data analysis and is difficult to follow.
*   **15 points:** The report provides an exploratory data analysis of all variables relevant to answering the research question(s) and testing the hypotheses but has minor flaws in one part or does not provide an interpretation of the initial findings.
*   **20 points:** The report provides a concise exploratory data analysis highlighting and explaining interesting findings about the variables relevant to answering the research question(s) and testing the hypotheses.

#### Method 1 (20 points)

*   **0 points:** The report does not provide this section.
*   **5 points:** The report conducts some analysis beyond the exploratory data analysis, but the analysis is not clearly related to the research question and hypotheses, or the analysis is not suitable for testing the stated hypotheses.
*   **10 points:** The analysis is suitable to test the hypotheses but has major flaws in how it is executed, reported, or interpreted.
*   **15 points:** The analysis is suitable to test the hypotheses but has some minor flaws in how it is executed, reported, or interpreted.
*   **20 points:** The analysis is suitable for testing the hypotheses, the most important assumptions are checked, the results are well-reported, and the results are correctly interpreted.

#### Method 2 (20 points)

*   **0 points:** The report does not provide this section.
*   **5 points:** The report conducts some analysis beyond the exploratory data analysis, but the analysis is not clearly related to the research question and hypotheses, or the analysis is not suitable for testing the stated hypotheses.
*   **10 points:** The analysis is suitable to test the hypotheses but has major flaws in how it is executed, reported, or interpreted.
*   **15 points:** The analysis is suitable to test the hypotheses but has some minor flaws in how it is executed, reported, or interpreted.
*   **20 points:** The analysis is suitable for testing the hypotheses, the most important assumptions are checked, the results are well-reported, and the results are correctly interpreted.

#### Quality of the code (15 points)

To show that your code runs, you have to execute all cells in order and save this version before you submit it.

*   **0 points:** The code has significant errors, causing most cells not to run.
*   **5 points:** Most cells run, but the notebook cannot be executed in order. Most code is missing comments making it difficult to understand the code.
*   **10 points:** All cells run, but some cells have minor flaws or missing comments.
*   **15 points:** All cells run according to the order of the notebook, are consistent with the reported results, and are well-commented.
